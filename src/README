Interface library for Astral data flows

libastral-0.5 is the beta version with limited functionality, don't expect
something too much from it. Also BEWARE of BUGS!

I. Installation
---------------
1. Ungzip 
and untar
2. Install it with command: make all
3. Run test command astral_test

II. Usage
---------
To connect with the Astral world use it's API top-level functions:

struct portal* astral_open();
int astral_close(struct portal *p);
int astral_listen(struct portal *p, char *voice_divine);

as it shown in astral_test.c sample program. For details of struct portal
see libastral.h file.
